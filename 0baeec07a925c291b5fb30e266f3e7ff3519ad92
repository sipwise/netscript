      "message": "I don\u0027t really agree here. We still have wheezy based systems (and IIRC even squeeze ones). Even if \"devops\" have all systems migrated to jessie we should still support installing wheezy - even if it\u0027s not automatically tested - since e.g. Gernot might want to install them.\n\nBut even if you disagree with me, let\u0027s forget this Debian/release specific stuff overall: puppetlabs\u0027 puppet-agent packages work fine for older Debian releases too. The puppet-agent packages from puppetlabs are supposed to behave similar everywhere. So instead I\u0027d remove all the squeeze/wheezy/jessie/... checks and just use the same code for all Debian releases. Then testing something for an older or a brand new Debian release is easy and for the ones we actually care about (jessie based as of now) we have according tests anyway.\n\nACK?",
